### Welcome to my corner of the internet! üëã
I'm interested in applying machine learning methods to solve challenges in the biomedical realm. 

My background includes a blend of machine (and deep) learning modelling & bioinformatics, and I develop statistical and ML methods to identify blood-based molecular markers of Parkinson's disease diagnosis and prognosis for my [doctoral studies](https://www.uni.lu/lcsb-en/research-groups/biomedical-data-science/). I was recently awarded a fellowship to do a research visit in Cambridge, where I focused on exciting graph representation learning models (aka graph ML or geometric DL) with [Pietro Li√≤](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) (Cambridge Univeristy) and  [Petar Veliƒçkoviƒá](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petarvelickovic/?originalSubdomain=uk) (Google DeepMind).

Beyond research, I'm a fellow of the 2023 [MIT Catalyst fellowhip program](https://catalyst.mit.edu/), where I explore the space of un-met needs in health(-tech) and I proudly serve as a [global shaper](https://www.globalshapers.org/) recognized by the World Economic Forum of Geneva. 

At work and in life, I thrive in collaborative, engaging atmospheres and enjoy sports, from padel tennis to running, with a special fondness for outdoor activities. While at Cambridge, I raced with the triathlon club the Varsity duathlon against Oxford - quite an experience! In my downtime, I enjoy indulging in a good book and the occasional slice of carrot cake with a glass of white wine.
