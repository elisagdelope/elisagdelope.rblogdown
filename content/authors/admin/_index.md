Welcome to my website. I'm motivated about machine learning methods applied to life science challenges. I also like carrot cake, white wine and a good book.


I studied biotechnology and bioinformatics, and I'm currently pursuing doctoral studies in Biomedical data science. I worked in tech consulting as a data scientist and interned as a bioinformatician before starting my PhD. I have a broad spectrum of interests, but the most important thing to know about me is that I get really immersed in my projects and put all my energy to go the extra mile.
