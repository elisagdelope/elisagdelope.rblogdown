### Welcome to my corner of the internet! üëã
I'm interested in applying machine learning methods to solve challenges in the biomedical realm.

My background includes a blend of machine (and deep) learning modelling & bioinformatics. I currently work at the University of Luxembourg, where I extend my PhD work on graph representation learning for omics data. Additionally, I'm a [Google summer of code '24 contributor](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/554MrMl8) on the [*deepchem*](https://deepchem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library, where I integrate protein language models for predicting binding sites.

I recently graduated from my doctoral studies (yay!), in which I focused on statistical and ML methods to identify blood-based molecular markers for Parkinson's disease diagnosis and prognosis. One of the highlights of my PhD was being awarded [Fondation de Luxembourg's fellowship](https://www.uni.lu/fstm-fr/news/2022-pelican-grant-five-doctoral-students-awarded/) to do a research visit in Cambridge, where I focused on exciting graph representation learning models (aka graph ML or geometric DL) with [Pietro Li√≤](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) (Cambridge Univeristy) and  [Petar Veliƒçkoviƒá](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petarvelickovic/?originalSubdomain=uk) (Google DeepMind).

Beyond research, I'm a fellow of the 2023 [MIT Catalyst fellowhip program](https://catalyst.mit.edu/), where I explore the space of un-met needs in health(-tech) and I proudly serve as a [global shaper](https://www.globalshapers.org/) recognized by the World Economic Forum of Geneva. 

At work and in life, I thrive in collaborative, engaging atmospheres and enjoy sports, from padel tennis to running, with a special fondness for outdoor activities. While at Cambridge, I raced with the triathlon club the Varsity duathlon against Oxford - quite an experience! In my downtime, I enjoy indulging in a good book and the occasional slice of carrot cake with a glass of white wine.

Now that you know me a bit better, please don't hesitate to get in touch if you'd like to chat about any of the above (or anything in techbio) or if you're interested in collaborating on a project. I'm always open to new opportunities and connections ü§ó
