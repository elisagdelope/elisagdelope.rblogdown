### A world of opportunity üëã
I apply machine learning methods to solve challenges in biomedicine.

Currently working at Keysight Technologies as a ML researcher, my background includes a blend of machine (and deep) learning modelling & bioinformatics.

Some highlights of the last years: 
- Contributed to [DeepChem](https://deepchem.io/) integrating a protein language model to predict binding sites as part of the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) fellowship.
- Recently completed my PhD (yay!), focusing on statistical, ML, and graph representation learning methods to identify blood-based molecular markers for Parkinson's disease diagnosis and prognosis. Feature selection and engineering, confounding factors & explainable AI. Check it out [here](https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/60638)!
- During my PhD I got a [Fondation de Luxembourg's fellowship](https://www.uni.lu/fstm-fr/news/2022-pelican-grant-five-doctoral-students-awarded/) to visit Prof. [Pietro Li√≤](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) (Cambridge University) and  [Petar Veliƒçkoviƒá](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petarvelickovic/?originalSubdomain=uk) (Google DeepMind). I focused on graph representation learning models for omics data.
- While at Cambridge, racing with the triathlon club the Varsity duathlon against Oxford - quite an experience! *Obviously, we won*
- Fellow of the 2023 [MIT Catalyst program](https://catalyst.mit.edu/), exploring unmet needs in health(-tech) 
- Proud [global shaper](https://www.globalshapers.org/) recognized by the World Economic Forum of Geneva, to make the world a better place. 
- Discovered the joy indulging in a good book with the occasional slice of carrot cake or a glass of white wine.
- Some people read my <a href="https://elisagdelope.rbind.io/#posts" rel="noopener noreferrer">posts</a> on both technical and non technical stuff.

Get in touch if you‚Äôre tackling complex ML problems. I‚Äôm available for consulting and collaboration ü§ó
