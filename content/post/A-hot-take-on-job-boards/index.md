As someone who's recently gone through the job search process, I've come to a realization: job boards and LinkedIn applications aren't as effective as they seem. Connections and networking are far more crucial in landing a job. Sure, you may have already heard this before, but how do you get these connections and how do you leverage them to find a new job?

Finding a new job - i.e., getting a job offer - is a process that can be broken down into two main parts: getting the interest from an HR recruiter or hiring manager (this typically materializes in being invited to interview), and completing the interview process (hopefully with success). To be completely fair, in order to get a job offer there is a third factor - being selected as the best candidate -, but since that's largely out of your control, I suggest you focus on the two parts you can work on to significantly improve your chances of the third happening.

### The problem with job boards

We've all been there: scrolling through LinkedIn or other job listings, searching for that perfect match. You spot a job that catches your eye, and your hopes rise. You take a deep breath, fill out the (too long!) application form, and craft a cover letter that showcases your skills and passion. You imagine yourself in the role, and you're convinced you're the ideal candidate. You hit the “apply” button excited… and then the waiting game begins. The little issue with thinking you are the ideal candidate is two-fold: 1) it is in *your* head, not in the hiring manager’s head, and 2) it is in most candidates’ heads. You see +500 applicants after just 3h of the job being posted, and you're just one of many (sometimes thousands!) qualified candidates vying for the same position.


The sad truth is your awesome application just joined the sea of other candidates’ applications. Finally, sometimes after two days, sometimes after two months, the most feared response email arrives – often a generic rejection email  *“We regret to inform you…”*  that leaves you wondering what went wrong. The lack of feedback is frustrating, and the cycle repeats itself, leaving you feeling stuck and uncertain about your job search strategy. Hell, you even didn’t have the chance to explain why you were the optimal fit for the role!

In this post I write about this first stage of finding a new job: how to get noticed? How to get invitations to interview? I was there recently, and can attest that it’s often nothing about your qualifications, or not having that preferred skill they mentioned. You are indeed probably an optimal fit for the role, or at least a good enough fit for the role to merit interview. However, the problem is you are not standing out from the big crowd of applicants. You are doing what mostly everybody else is doing, and you are getting what mostly everybody else is getting: a boring rejection email. Don’t worry, I was there too. For good or bad, the job market has become increasingly competitive, and just applying in job boards is not enough. 


### The fast lane to interview: targeted search & connections

It is well known that to get different results you have to do things differently. 

I experienced the job boards frustration recently, and I found that expanding my network and reaching out to people in my desired companies and roles was a game-changer. To my surprise, most people were friendly and willing to share insights about their jobs and companies. 

Instead of applying to countless jobs, try targeting a smaller batch of roles that truly excite you. Reach out to people in those companies, especially those working in the team you are interested in (even the hiring manager if you know who they are!), and ask about their experiences. Yes, I know you may not know anyone working there. I didn’t either! So what? I cold-messaged several people to show interest for the open role and ask about their jobs: what tasks and responsibilities they had, what was the team dynamics and atmosphere, what they liked, what they missed from previous roles, etc. Anything you want to know!

This approach requires more time and effort, I’m not going to lie. Despite the tediousness of filling job platforms like workdays and waiting for days and weeks to receive positive response (spoiler: never happens!), that is easier than the hassle of checking who works for the company/team of interest, reaching out, arranging informal meetings,… which takes a lot of mental space as well. But the payoff can be significant. It’s probably because not everybody does it, that it shows a large dose of interest that sets you appart. In my experience, every time I reached out to someone, I got a positive response, which often led to an interview or a connection with the hiring manager who will start the interview process. YAY!! Mission accomplished. And there you see the vast advantage over “easy-apply” candidates.

In addition, not only can this type of targeted search and networking help you get your foot in the door, but it also provides valuable insights into the company culture and team dynamics. By talking to your potentially future teammates, you can gauge whether you'd be a good fit and avoid potential red flags.

I want to encourage you, yes you, who are looking for a job, that putting in effort early in the process usually pays off. While job boards and LinkedIn applications can be tempting, they often lead to disappointment. By putting yourself out there, expanding your network if necessary, and reaching out to people in your desired industry, you can increase your chances of getting noticed and landing an interview for your dreamed job, and in your dreamed companies!  Finally, remember that connections and networking can bring you to the door, but it's up to you to succeed in the interview process, and you will have to prepare for that. But hey, at least you got over the first step, which is already a lot!
