Moving to a new place is never easy: you have to look for an apartment, maybe also
find a job in your new place, a school for your children (if any),  move all your belongings,
and worst of all, you will face an incredibly high amount of bureaucracy to deal with during
the first days, weeks, months, and even years at your future homeplace. You may also face a new
language as well, visa requirements, healthcare, bank and phone providers, and a long etcetera.
And the cherry on the cake is now you will face a wide variety of covid restrictions depending
on the country of origin and destination.

Fortunately, moving usually has an optimistic and
solid-based motivation: a (better) job, joining your partner or family, the start of a new
project, â€¦ There are plenty of good reasons for moving countries, and indeed living abroad and
getting out of your comfort zone can bring a lot of positive things to your life! (as you can
see in the recently released Netflix series Emily in Paris).

That said, you will find extra obstacles when moving countries during such an extraordinary
situation as the covid-19 pandemic, and it is important to be aware of them as much as possible,
so that you can overcome them and avoid wasting time, money and tears. So, you guys be strong
and stick to your motivation when you doubt the worth. In the end everything will be fine! For
different reasons, I had to do 2 movings during this year 2020, both during the pandemic and
between quite affected countries. And I still survived! If you plan to move countries in the
following months, just relax and try to be organized so that you can plan eventual difficulties
in advance.  You have a list of steps to get you ready to move abroad in the blog 
ðŸ‘‰[*teaspoonofadventure*](https://teaspoonofadventure.com/move-abroad-checklist/), 
which is very complete and the one I check for my movings. I will just try to add some details 
to consider related to the pandemic context.

One of the first tasks in the list is to choose Day D. Consider
potential quarantine periods in your future destination or the need of a negative covid test.
Depending on how dramatic is the situation, you might also depend on the available flights or
transport means and check if your reasons for crossing countries are compliant with
cross-border policies.

Next, focus on â€˜closingâ€™ your stage at your place of origin. Talk about your plans of leaving
to your flatmates and/or landlord, to your family or associates if you share any ownership, and
to the bank if you have a mortgage. You might need to find someone else to replace you or to buy
your property. And believe me, you will definitely need time to post adds and organize meetings
and visits! Multiple visits at a time might not be allowed, and be prepared to do show-rooms via
Skype/zoom/webex/â€¦ for those who are interested but cannot attend in-person visits. It might feel
risky, but in some occasions you will have no alternative but to trust someone you never saw in
person!

You might also need to find accommodation in the destination country. I will not go
into detail because finding an apartment is a burden task by itself and can vary from one country
to another, but once again, start your search well in advance and
prioritize flexible options just in case for any of the multiple covid-related reasons your
travel gets dalayed for some days. I have suffered all kind of pains for getting my apartment in
Luxembourg and thanks god I had some help from the university. Maybe your employer can provide
something temporary for your first weeks. All in all, these things are stressing
and take a while, don't leave it to the last minute.

If you are working at the time prior to the moving, announce you are leaving in advance so that you
give your manager time to adapt and reschedule deadlines if necessary, same as you would do when
there was no corona. Also, you will probably need to train your replacement, and very likely you
will do that through video-conference, which is not the most convenient and again, will take longer
than in the old normal. You can organize a farewell videoconference to say goodbye and greet your
colleagues for the time shared. Okay, it wonâ€™t be the same as the farewell beers but at least you
will prove your creativity and your intentions to have a warm discharge.

Finally, check for any special documentation that you might need for the corresponding restrictions
on travel. If you cannot find information on the internet, call the corresponding embassy at your
origin country. They usually know the very last minute updates and will be able to explain what you
need in your specific context (and they will explain it in English -which not all internet forums
do- !)

Now you are all good to go! Remember to keep you mask and handwasher close, and also try to be
patient and flexible. In the end corona has taught us all the things that are really important to
worry about and those that arenâ€™t. Take it easy, stay safe, and all the best for your adventure!
