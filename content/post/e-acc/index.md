Lately, I’ve noticed “e/acc” popping up in the bios of tech influencers on Twitter (now X). Like many, I was initially puzzled: what is this new buzzword? Turns out, it’s a fresh philosophical wave known as effective accelerationism (*e/acc* in short), where the future is now and technology is the driver. For someone who viewed philosophy as ancient musings, this was a surprise. Yet, *e/acc* offers a compelling narrative on tech, AI, society, and what lies ahead. While I’ve loosely followed social media panicking on AGI’s potential perils, my stance leans away from Europe’s heavy-handed regulations. 

This movement has piqued my interest, and it’s worth exploring the whole whirlwind of debates surrounding *e/acc*. Whether you’re a tech enthusiast or a curious bystander, *e/acc* is a conversation you’ll want to join. 


### The origin of e/acc

In the digital heartbeat of the 21st century, a new thought has emerged: *e/acc*. Rooted in the belief that technology is the catalyst for solving humanity’s grandest challenges, *e/acc* is not just a philosophy; it’s a call to action for unfettered innovation. 

Nick Land is often hailed as the father of “contemporary” accelerationism, but the roots of *e/acc* are less clear. Its earliest trace? A May 2022 newsletter by pseudonymous authors like [@BasedBeffJezos](https://x.com/BasedBeffJezos) (later revealed to be Guillaume Verdon, a Canadian ex-Google quantum engineer) and [@bayeslord](https://x.com/bayeslord). Once a fringe concept, *e/acc* gained mainstream attention in 2023, with Verdon recognized as its pioneer on the [Lex Fridman Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fEEbKJoNbU).



### A tech-driven utopia

Imagine a world where AI solves poverty, cures diseases, and even tackles climate change. Sounds amazing, right? I mean, what if technology could solve all our problems overnight? That’s the *e/acc* vision. It’s a techno-optimistic sprint towards a utopia powered by Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). But it’s more than wishful thinking; it’s about swift creation. *E/acc* is rooted in Silicon Valley’s transhumanism and extropianism, ideologies that advocate for progress and resist technological restraint, resonating with the [Cybernetic Culture Research Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetic_Culture_Research_Unit)’s principles.

Like with every new current of thought, not everyone is ready to hit the gas. Critics argue that *e/acc*’s pedal-to-the-metal approach to AI could lead to ethical pile-ups and societal skid marks. The most heated debates are -like in many other topics- regulation vs. freedom, and safety vs. speed in building and advancing in the AI’s fierce race to the future. Despite many of its proponents having libertarian views, *e/acc* claims to be not right or left wing, transcending political binaries and aiming for a future where technology uplifts civilization: *“We don’t want to see the world spiral into oblivion. This is not the accelerationism your friends on reddit are worried about. We’re optimistic about the future of technology and civilization, and we want others to feel the same.”* ([Legacy substack](https://www.effectiveacceleration.org/tag/legacy-substack)).  

However, critics warn that this approach is not without risks and ethical dilemmas. Ethical implications include concerns over societal impacts of swift technological change. There’s also the risk of overreach, where the push for rapid progress could result in the premature deployment of technologies that haven’t been fully tested for safety and reliability. Critics of *e/acc* highlight the potential for a loss of human control, the conenctration of power in the hands of a few, and a disregard for safety concerns, which could have serious repercussions. As the old latin saying goes *In medio virtus*, balancing these risks with the benefits of effective accelerationism requires careful consideration and a commitment to integrating ethical foresight into the process of rapid innovation.



### Leadership or collective movement?

While *e/acc* is associated with a number of high-profile Silicon Valley figures like investors Marc Andreessen, Garry Tan, and Martin Shkreli, who explicitly endorse it by adding “e/acc” to their public social media profiles, the movement itself claims to have no official leaders. *“[e/acc] is designed to be robust to the attack vectors prevalent in our world. Journalism, mob rule, cancellation, and capture by simple-minded and virally memetic partisan extremist ideologies, etc. We respect anonymity..”* explains a contributor to the movement in the [effectiveaccelerationism.org](https://www.effectiveacceleration.org/) forum.

### Public pit stops

What is the public opinion about this topic? As far as I’ve seen over Twitter, it’s a mixed bag, often split along geographic lines. Some (mostly US-based) are all-in, revving their engines at the thought of a high-speed tech revolution. Others (you guessed, mostly Europe) are more cautious, preferring a controlled, scenic route over the *e/acc* expressway.

Contrary to my initial belief that philosophy was a relic of the past, it turns out to be more relevant than ever. *E/acc* isn’t just a set of ideas; it’s a visionary blueprint for swift technological progress.

Now, I turn to you. What’s your take? Are you ready to press the accelerator, or do you have reservations about where we’re headed? I’d love to hear more thoughts about this.
