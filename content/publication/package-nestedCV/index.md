abstract: NestedCV() is a python class compatible with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) extensions. It provides functions that streamline the nested cross-validation setting for several ML algorithms, and can be used in scikit-learn pipelines and (hyper)parameter search. This package was created as a [scikit-learn project-template](https://sklearn-template.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick_start.html).
